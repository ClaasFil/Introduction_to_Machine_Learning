Introduction to Machine Learning - Class Assignments

This repository contains my coursework and projects from the Introduction to Machine Learning class I took at the University of Vienna. The coursework involved a series of programming assignments that helped me develop practical skills in machine learning.

    Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for machine learning models, including normalization, splitting into training and test sets, and handling of missing values.

    Model Selection and Evaluation: Selecting appropriate machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision-recall.

    Supervised Learning: Implemented and trained models for both regression and classification tasks, gaining hands-on experience with algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

    Feature Selection and Engineering: Practiced techniques for selecting the most relevant features for a model and engineered new features to improve model performance.

    Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: Explored advanced topics like kernelized SVMs, developing custom kernels, and utilizing ensemble methods to enhance predictions.

    Practical Machine Learning Pipeline: Built end-to-end machine learning pipelines, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Projects Overview

    Movie Recommendation System: Developed a system using collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user ratings.

    Digit Classification: Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, using only Numpy, to recognize handwritten digits, focusing on understanding neural networks and gradient-based learning.

    Cancer Diagnosis Prediction: Employed SVMs and feature selection methods to predict cancer diagnoses from biopsy data, highlighting the importance of feature selection in high-dimensional data.

    Custom Kernel Development: Designed and tested a custom kernel for SVM, demonstrating an understanding of kernel methods and their impact on model performance.
